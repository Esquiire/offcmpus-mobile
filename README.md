# Offcmpus Mobile

This repo makes up the core of our mobile efforts for the Offcmpus platform, built with Flutter.

To compile and build this code, you need:

- Flutter 2.0 or later
- Flutter SDK
- Android Studio + Android SDK
- Android Emulator from Studio or connected Android phone over USB

You can download Flutter [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  Once Flutter is installed on the correct system, run `flutter doctor` in a command line (assuming Flutter was properly added to the PATH).  Complete the doctor requirements, and then Flutter will be ready to develop.
